# The Art of Aari: What Makes Hand Aari Work Different from Machine Embroidery?

Aari work has existed for centuries, but today it’s having a renaissance. Brides and fashion lovers prefer Aari because it celebrates something that machines simply cannot replicate — the touch of a skilled artisan.

## ✨ What Is Aari Work?

Aari embroidery is done using a hooked needle called *Aari* or *Maggam needle*.  
The fabric is stretched tightly on a wooden frame, and each stitch is created manually by rotating the hook in rhythmic motions.

It’s not just embroidery.  
It’s workmanship… one precise stitch at a time.

## 🎨 Why Hand Aari Feels More Luxurious

Hand Aari uses finer materials like:
- Pure zari
- Swarovski stones
- Beads
- Cutdana
- Pearls

Every motif breathes life because an artisan’s hand decides where the shimmer rests and how the thread flows.

Machine embroidery can replicate patterns.  
Hand Aari creates emotions.

When something is crafted with patience and passion, you don’t just wear it…  
you *feel* it.
