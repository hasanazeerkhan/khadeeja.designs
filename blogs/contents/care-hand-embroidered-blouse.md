# How to Care for Your Hand-Embroidered Blouse

Hand-embroidered blouses are not just outfits — they’re art. Each stitch holds hours of craftsmanship and tradition.  
To keep that beauty intact for years, these care tips will help you preserve the embroidery, fabric, and shine.

## 1. Always Use Gentle Hand-Wash

Avoid machine wash — the agitation can pull threads and damage delicate embroidery.  
Use cold water and a mild detergent (preferably a liquid meant for silks).

**How to wash safely:**
- Turn the blouse inside out  
- Soak for no more than 5–7 minutes  
- Gently squeeze, don’t scrub

## 2. Never Wring or Twist the Fabric

Embroidery threads can snap if twisted.  
Instead, place the blouse on a clean towel and press gently to remove excess water.

## 3. Dry in Shade — Not Direct Sunlight

Sunlight can fade both thread and fabric colors.

**Drying tip:**  
Lay it flat, don’t hang. Hanging can stretch the neckline and distort embroidery.

## 4. Iron with a Protective Layer

Heat can dull or flatten embroidery.  
Always use a pressing cloth (a thin cotton fabric) over the blouse before ironing.

**Use settings:**
- Low heat or silk mode
- No steam directly on embroidery

## 5. Store with Tissue Paper

Avoid plastic covers — moisture can get trapped and cause fungus or discoloration.

**For best storage:**
- Wrap the blouse in acid-free tissue paper
- Place it in a breathable cotton bag or muslin cover
- Add silica gel packets to prevent moisture

## 6. Bead & Thread Check Before Wearing

Before a big event, check for:
- loose threads  
- dangling beads  
- open stitches  

A small quick fix now avoids bigger damage later.

## 7. Avoid Perfume & Makeup Contact

Spraying perfume or mist directly on the embroidery can stain the threads.  
Apply perfume **before** wearing your blouse — let it dry, then slip into your masterpiece.

### Final Thought

A hand-embroidered blouse deserves the same care you give to anything precious in life —  
*gentle hands, patience, and attention to detail.*

When you care for your embroidery with love,  
it doesn’t just last longer…  
it becomes a memory that travels with you.
